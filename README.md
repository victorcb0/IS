# IS (Information Security)
Information security is a fundamental concern in the digital age, where data is a valuable and ubiquitous resource. It aims to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data against threats and cyber attacks. This involves implementing appropriate policies and technologies to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information, ensure that data remains unaltered and is available when needed. Hands-on labs in information security provide the opportunity for participants to understand and experience techniques and tools used to protect and assess the security of systems and data, thus contributing to the development of a safer and more threat-resistant digital environment.

## Laboratory 1 - The Unix Password Based Authentication System
The lab consists of a detailed analysis of the password-based authentication system in the Unix environment. Analysis of the password-based authentication system in Unix reveals a robust structure, but not without vulnerabilities. Its foundation is based on the /etc/passwd file, which stores information about users, including encrypted passwords. However, in modern systems this was replaced by /etc/shadow to improve security, as /etc/passwd was accessible to all users. Additionally, the password encryption algorithm (typically MD5, SHA-256, or SHA-512) is a crucial component of the authentication system. However, attack methods such as brute force attacks or the use of weak passwords remain a major concern. Also, proper management of access rights and strong password policies are essential to protect the system from compromise. Therefore, the analysis of this system emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach to ensure the security and integrity of authentication in the Unix environment.

## Laboratory 2 - Symmetric Encryption in .NET
The Symmetric Encryption in .NET Lab is an interactive experience that explores various encryption algorithms, including DES, 3DES, and Rijndael. In this lab, a customized program is created in which they can choose the desired encryption algorithm and generate the key and the initial vector. Through an intuitive interface, users can enter text in ASCII format and, by pressing the "Encrypt" button, the text is encrypted and presented in HEX format. For decryption, users can use the corresponding button, generating the decrypted text in both ASCII and HEX format. Furthermore, the lab provides the functionality to measure the time required to encrypt and decrypt a block message, thus providing insight into the performance of encryption algorithms in real time. This hands-on experience gives participants a deeper understanding of symmetric encryption concepts and their impact on processing time.

## Laboratory 3 - Hash Functions and MAC Codes in .NET
The Hash Functions and MAC Codes in .NET lab explores various hashing algorithms, including SHA1, MD5, RIPEMD, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512.

Using text entered into a text field, users can then press the "Compute MAC" button to generate the associated MAC code, presented in both ASCII and HEX format. The function of the "Verify MAC" button is to verify the correspondence between the generated MAC and the one entered in HEX format, thus providing an effective way to verify data integrity. This lab provides valuable hands-on experience in understanding and applying the concepts of hashes and MAC codes in the context of cybersecurity and data protection.
